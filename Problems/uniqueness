There are two unsorterd arrays A and B of arbitrary length containing only integers.  
Write a function that returns ALL objects that exist in B or A, but NOT BOTH A and B.

e.g.
A = [1,91,0,12,34,65,3,87,2342,45,23,97,23,76]
B = [123,456,6785,23,9898,34,65,23,76,9,45,8,34,1,3,4,7,0,23]

Rember this should work an any two n and m respectively length arrays. For instance A.size=1,000,000  B.size=10,000,000
would be arrays that your method should support. Duplicates *within* each array do not count against uniqueness *between* arrays.
